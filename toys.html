	<h2>Importance of Dog Toys</h2>
	<p>Toys are important to your dog's well-being. Toys help fight boredom when you have to leave your dog at home, and provide comfort when they're feeling nervous. Toys can even help prevent your dog from developing certain problem behaviors. Think of enrichment as something no less necessary for your dog than exercise, good nutrition, and medical care. Keeping our dogs mentally stimulated helps prevent boredom and problem behaviors, decreases stress, and builds confidence. Most importantly, enriched dogs are happy dogs! The research suggests that many dogs, if they had their way, would get new objects constantly (I'm sure the pet product industry is thrilled). ... Dogs habituate all the time, to the sound of an airplane going by or a baby crying; this is a good thing, but I'm sure people would rather dogs don't habituate to toys.</p>

	<h2>Dog Toys Made At Home</h2>
	<ul id="dogtoys">
		<li class="toylist"><span>BALL TUG TOY</span><br>You’ll need an old T-shirt, a tennis ball and a pair of scissors to whip up this totally tuggable dog toy. Simply lay your shirt flat and cut across in three strategic places, according to She Knows, then wrap the ball inside two of the pieces. Use the smallest piece of shirt to cinch the toy together. Cut the remaining pieces of cloth into strips and braid.</li>
		<hr class="toyruler">
		<li class="toylist"><span>INTERACTIVE DOG FEEDER TOY</span><br>A PVC pipe is the main ingredient in this sturdy feeding toy created by Dog Tipper, which aims to keep your pooch busy by making him work for the treats inside. You’ll need to be somewhat handy to drill holes into the pipe, which you can do best when the pipe is secured in a vise. Sand the rough edges of your holes with sandpaper and when all of them are smooth, put the pipe into the dishwasher for cleaning. Put PVC caps on each end of the pipe.</li>

		<hr class="toyruler">
		<li class="toylist"><span>T-SHIRT ROPE TOY</span><br>That stack of T-shirts in the closet that nobody is wearing, they can be turned into T-shirt yarn for your next project. T-shirt yarn is just long, thin strips of T-shirt, which looks super colorful when it’s braided — but we’re not talking about just any braid. You’ll need 12 strings of yarn (at about 1-2 yards long) to braid this yarn into a rope toy using the scoubidou technique (a.k.a. the friendship bracelet method). If you’re already anxious, don’t worry. It’s pretty easy, and YouTube has tons of tutorials.</li>
		<hr class="toyruler">
		<li class="toylist"><span>DIY AGILITY TOY</span><br>Give your dog extra exercise with this easy-to-make agility jump that can be set up in your backyard, or, if you’re feeling brave, your living room. Gone to the Snow Dogs built their own using furniture grade PVC pipe (both white and blue) and different kinds of furniture grade PVC fitting. The important thing here is having a PVC pipe cutter — and knowing how to use one! — and carefully cutting each piece as instructed (the long white pipes, which will be the ground bar, need to measure 47 inches long). Follow the directions provided and you’ll have leftovers for future projects.</li>
		<hr class="toyruler">
		<li class="toylist"><span>ROPE BALL TOY</span><br>You’re going to need patience (and some pliers!) to tackle the tying involved in this rope toy recipe, courtesy of Instructables. Things you’ll need: rope (3/4-inch diameter), a lacrosse ball, and some electrical tape. First, unwind between 10 to 15 feet of the rope and tape the ends. If you’re fluent in “knot,” the next steps will be a synch for you, if not, there are how-to’s provided for each knot. Pliers can be useful pulling through strands of rope.</li>
		<hr class="toyruler">
		<li class="toylist"><span>NO-SEW DENIM TOY</span><br>No sewing machine? No problem! All you need to make this toy is some scissors and an old pair of jeans. First, cut the pant legs into long strips and lay them in a cross shape on a table. Kelley Nagel’s step-by-step video shows you how to flip and fold the legs into knots. The finished product is simple, sturdy, and so much fun to chew, as the dog in the video demonstrates.</li>
